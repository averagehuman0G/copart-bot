# copart-bot

Previously using Phantomjs, but has now been updated to use Puppeeter.

A simple - for now - script that will fetch all vehicles searched for from 2014 - 2018

THINGS TO BE COMPLETED --------

Attaching a database to save all cars that should be looked at according to an algorithm
If a car is common we want to look beyond the first page, which only displays 100 cars
We want to further filter these vehicles by the damage type
